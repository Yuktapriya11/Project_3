â€‹This project focuses on segmenting customers based on demographic and purchasing behaviors using clustering techniques, particularly K-Means, to identify distinct groups within the dataset. By analyzing features such as age, annual income, and spending score, the project aims to uncover patterns that can inform targeted marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement. The methodology includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score, applying K-Means clustering, and visualizing the results through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and pair plots. The insights derived from this analysis can assist businesses in tailoring their approaches to different customer segments, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and profitability.
